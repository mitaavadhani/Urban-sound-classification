This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and code for classifying urban sounds using various machine learning models like- 
1. Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Network(RNN)
4. Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM).
   
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate models that can accurately classify different types of urban sounds.
To run the notebooks, use Google Colab.

The project uses the UrbanSound8K dataset. UrbanSound8K is a collection of 8,732 labeled urban sound excerpts (with a length of 4.0 seconds) from 10 different classes. The dataset is ideal for training and evaluating models for urban sound classification.
